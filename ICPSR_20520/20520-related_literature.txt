This paper assesses estimates of immigrant intergenerational mobility that
are based on
aggregate data sources. We show that aggregation bias strongly inflates
estimates of the
relationship between immigrants’ educational attainment and the educational
attainment
of their children. Compared to natives, the educational transmission
process between
parent and child is much weaker in immigrant families. A number of group-
level
processes, such as societal discrimination, ethnic segregation, or ethnic
networks, may
render group characteristics more important predictors of second generation
educational
attainment than parental education.

This paper assesses estimates of immigrant intergenerational mobility that
are based on
aggregate data sources. We show that aggregation bias strongly inflates
estimates of the
relationship between immigrants’ educational attainment and the educational
attainment
of their children. Compared to natives, the educational transmission
process between
parent and child is much weaker in immigrant families. A number of group-
level
processes, such as societal discrimination, ethnic segregation, or ethnic
networks, may
render group characteristics more important predictors of second generation
educational
attainment than parental education.

This study used data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study,
which consists of a two-wave panel of approximately 2,500 second generation
students in Florida's Dade County public schools, to investigate the impact
of non-immigrant/involuntary minority enrollment in second generation
Hispanic students' academic achievement. Students completed the survey in
eighth and ninth grade, then again in their senior year of high school. The
survey collected data on students' age, sex, place of birth, and parent
nationality, education, and occupation. Students' grade point averages and
standardized math scores were also obtained, as well as data on the
school's racial composition, size of enrollment, and proportion of students
on government-subsidized lunch. Data analysis indicated that oppositional
effects that operated through involuntary minority concentration in the
school had negative consequences for immigrant male achievement. The grade
point averages and math performance of Nicaraguan and Cuban males suffered
in the company of involuntary minorities, net of other school and
individual level differences. Cuban and Nicaraguan girls, however, receive
community and parental supervision that may serve as a buffer to the
incorporation of oppositional attitudes along with their negative
consequences on academic achievement. (SM)

This study used data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study,
which consists of a two-wave panel of approximately 2,500 second generation
students in Florida's Dade County public schools, to investigate the impact
of non-immigrant/involuntary minority enrollment in second generation
Hispanic students' academic achievement. Students completed the survey in
eighth and ninth grade, then again in their senior year of high school. The
survey collected data on students' age, sex, place of birth, and parent
nationality, education, and occupation. Students' grade point averages and
standardized math scores were also obtained, as well as data on the
school's racial composition, size of enrollment, and proportion of students
on government-subsidized lunch. Data analysis indicated that oppositional
effects that operated through involuntary minority concentration in the
school had negative consequences for immigrant male achievement. The grade
point averages and math performance of Nicaraguan and Cuban males suffered
in the company of involuntary minorities, net of other school and
individual level differences. Cuban and Nicaraguan girls, however, receive
community and parental supervision that may serve as a buffer to the
incorporation of oppositional attitudes along with their negative
consequences on academic achievement. (SM)
